 # About the project
 The worlds of today are shifting more in Favour of online commerce. Because of this, Email marketing bots are crucial to the expansion of businesses. Every business owner gains potential clients once they have earned their trust and respect. Therefore, the entrepreneur must interact with their customer in order to address this issue. And as far as we are aware, there are not just one or two customers. interacting with numerous customers here on a regular basis Technology enables the mailing of bulk emails, which is done in a matter of seconds and at a lower cost. Using replit makes this process much easier. It is a platform that is simple to use and doesn't require high programming skills. Without having to worry about installing dependencies, we may focus more on the task at hand. Every developer, in my opinion, should try replit.
